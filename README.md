This is a project given to me during my application to a BYU Programming job, the aim was to create a tic tac toe game against a CPU within specific constraints.
The program is self-explanatory; you will be playing (X) against the CPU (O) and select a space by typing the number associated with the position.
You will win if you get three of your symbols lined up in a row, lose if the CPU reaches the conditions first, and tie if the board fills before either win.
As mentioned in my notes, this project took me approximately 3 hours and 15 minutes to complete.
