This is a project given to me durring my application to a BYU Programming job, the aim was to create a tic tac toe game against a CPU within specific constraints.
The program is pretty self explanitory, you will be playing (X) against the CPU (O), and you will select a space by typing the number associated with the position.
You will win if you get three of your symbols lined up in a row, lose if the CPU reaches the conditions first, and tie if the board fills before either win.
